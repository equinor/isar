Alembic is used to migrate the databases. [link](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/front.html#installation)

# Creating new migrations
Requires setting the correct environment variable connection string `ISAR_PERSISTENT_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` for the database. 
```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Migration name"
```
This will compare what is in the metadata of sqlalchemy Base with what is in the database and create a migration for it. 

# Run migration
```
alembic upgrade head
```
